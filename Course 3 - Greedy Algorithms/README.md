## 3. [Greedy Algorithms](https://github.com/StephanePEILLET/Algorithms_Specialization/tree/main/Course%203%20-%20Greedy%20Algorithms)

This part covers the several subjects: greedy algorithms (scheduling, minimum spanning trees, clustering, Huffman codes) and dynamic programming (knapsack, sequence alignment, optimal search trees).
