## 4. [Shortest Paths Revisited](https://github.com/StephanePEILLET/Algorithms_Specialization/tree/main/Course%204%20-%20Shortest%20Paths%20Revisited%20)

Finally the topics in this part are: shortest paths (Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, Johnson), NP-completeness and what it means for the algorithm designer, and strategies for coping with computationally intractable problems (analysis of heuristics, local search).
