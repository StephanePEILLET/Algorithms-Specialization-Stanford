# [Graph Search](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-graphs-data-structures)

  The topics in this part on the specialization are: data structures (heaps, balanced search trees, hash tables, bloom filters), graph primitives (applications of breadth-first and depth-first search, connectivity, shortest paths), and their applications (ranging from deduplication to social network analysis).
