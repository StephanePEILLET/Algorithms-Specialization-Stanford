# Algorithms Specialization - Stanford University 

This repository contains slides and algorithm implementations from the [Algorithms Specialization offered by Stanford University on Coursera.](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms#courses)

## 1. Divide and Conquer 
##### [Link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-divide-conquer) - [Code](here)

  The primary topics in this part of the specialization are: asymptotic ("Big-oh") notation, sorting and searching, divide and conquer (master method, integer and matrix multiplication, closest pair), and randomized algorithms (QuickSort, contraction algorithm for min cuts).

## 2. Graph Search 
##### [Link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-graphs-data-structures) - [Code](here)

  The topics in this part on the specialization graph are: data structures (heaps, balanced search trees, hash tables, bloom filters), graph primitives (applications of breadth-first and depth-first search, connectivity, shortest paths), and their applications (ranging from deduplication to social network analysis).
  
## 3.  Greedy Algorithms 
##### [Link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-greedy) - [Code](here)
  This part covers the several subjects: greedy algorithms (scheduling, minimum spanning trees, clustering, Huffman codes) and dynamic programming (knapsack, sequence alignment, optimal search trees).
  
## 4. Shortest Paths Revisited 
##### [Link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-npcomplete) - [Code](here)
  Finally the topics in this part are: shortest paths (Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, Johnson), NP-completeness and what it means for the algorithm designer, and strategies for coping with computationally intractable problems (analysis of heuristics, local search).
