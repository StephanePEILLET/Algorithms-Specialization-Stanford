# Algorithms Specialization - Stanford University 

This repository contains slides and implementations of the [Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms#courses) offered by Stanford University on Coursera.

## 1. [Divide and Conquer](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-divide-conquer)

  The primary topics in this part of the specialization are: asymptotic ("Big-oh") notation, sorting and searching, divide and conquer (master method, integer and matrix multiplication, closest pair), and randomized algorithms (QuickSort, contraction algorithm for min cuts).

1. [Karatsuba](https://github.com/StephanePEILLET/Algorithms_Specialization/blob/main/Course%201%20-%20Divide%20and%20Conquer/Codes/karatsuba.py)  
2. [MergeSort](https://github.com/StephanePEILLET/Algorithms_Specialization/blob/main/Course%201%20-%20Divide%20and%20Conquer/Codes/mergesort.py)  
3. [Counting Inversions](https://github.com/StephanePEILLET/Algorithms_Specialization/blob/main/Course%201%20-%20Divide%20and%20Conquer/Codes/counting_inversions.py)  
4. [QuickSort](https://github.com/StephanePEILLET/Algorithms_Specialization/blob/main/Course%201%20-%20Divide%20and%20Conquer/Codes/quicksort.py)
5. [KargerMinCut](https://github.com/StephanePEILLET/Algorithms_Specialization/blob/main/Course%201%20-%20Divide%20and%20Conquer/Codes/karger.py)

## 2. [Graph Search](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-graphs-data-structures) 

  The topics in this part on the specialization are: data structures (heaps, balanced search trees, hash tables, bloom filters), graph primitives (applications of breadth-first and depth-first search, connectivity, shortest paths), and their applications (ranging from deduplication to social network analysis).
  
## 3. [Greedy Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-greedy)

  This part covers the several subjects: greedy algorithms (scheduling, minimum spanning trees, clustering, Huffman codes) and dynamic programming (knapsack, sequence alignment, optimal search trees).

## 4. [Shortest Paths Revisited](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-npcomplete)

  Finally the topics in this part are: shortest paths (Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, Johnson), NP-completeness and what it means for the algorithm designer, and strategies for coping with computationally intractable problems (analysis of heuristics, local search).
